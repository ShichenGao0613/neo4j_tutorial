uYljlxIY3cHRqxCC_MRtYQ,review,"I finally found Burger Culture and was primed and ready to have my socks blown off. Well, that's what I wanted, but it is not exactly what I got.
A friend raved about the Cajun burger & it defiantly sounded right in my wheel house. I have to say underwhelmed is an understatement. 
I expected great things from this mobile burger monger. If their was Cajun seasoning, let's just say it was undetectable.  The mushrooms were soggy and did not add to the already lacking burger. The size was nice & the smoked gouda was good ( how's that for being an optamist).
The fries were touted as being fresh, perfectly cooked and having sea salt & Parmesson cheese. I am a fry fanatic,  it is so hard to get properly cooked fries out, I was looking equally to the fries & the burger to impress. Unfortunately the fries were tempid and lacked any pizazz,  but they were a major salt lick.
Every time I see that orange truck, I want to give it another try, but my car just passes it by, to try a new adventure.
What's a girl to do? Tasteless burgers & salty fries, just are not good eats."

We arrived about 10:30 on a Friday and while the restaurant was busy, we were seated immediately and greeted quickly by Paige.   She was helpful and didn't rush.    Convinced us to try the biscuits and she was right -- AWESOME!     Love this place."

Service: We were treated like royalty on both occasions we appeared this week. Yes we went twice in the span of 7 days because it was that good. If your waitress is Kelly, be prepared for some warm pleasantries surpassed by none. 

Food: You're a fool if you don't go for 50 cent oysters during happy hour. Oysters the size of your palm. No joke. Now for the bread. There must be a bakery in the back. It's the perfect balance of crusty deliciousness and soft fluffy heaven. The shrimp and grits is beyond worth it. The sauce alone is ridiculous."

k1paHQJ9ZLA77FsQp-LMKg,review,I had a dozen of oysters here. They were fresh but lack of taste in my opinion. They were very bland. I missed the smell and taste of the sea when eating them. The oysters were big - maybe a little too big. I am more a fan of the delicate oysters from the Normandy in France.

After looking at the prices I was a little disappointed, but after eating there I was a believer. The portions are very generous, very splittable. Cmon, a giant spring roll burrito? Genius."

I won't go to any other Tijuana flats because they never compare! I bring my friends here and they're always amazed at how good the food is! Every time i come in the restaurant is clean and the employees all look like they're happy to be there! They're always smiling and singing along to the music and just overall super helpful! It's also One of my favorite places to go in Wesley chapel because I can bring my dog with me and sit outside and they always bring out water for her! Keep up the great work guys!!!"
MwmkPvCXkujN9fHpTwz46w,review,"Nice place with indoor and outdoor seating. Blue cheese fries were yummy. 
They have happy hour 4-6pm everyday $1 oysters. I ate too many. 
Place was clean and staff was friendly."
hRej8MgSHrN9PMUiBNEhCg,review,I've been here many times for cocktails and it's a must stop. Hopefully when you come here Kevin is bartending because he is the best in the Quarter. Don't be afraid to let him chose your drink. Can't wait to return!
TZpM6J1MGPiD6_IfhsxDtg,review,"This is a fantastic place to try some less commercial craft beers. I love their location as well as their space, they have a bar as well as a dining room. I have eaten here for lunch and the food was very good. They also serve breakfast and dinner. They have good options, snacks, salads, indie favorites, herbivores and German style. I had the Habana Cuban sandwich which was excellent. 
They have indoor and outdoor seating so perfect when the weather cools down. They usually have about 14-15 beers on tap and a huge bottle selection. 
Located in the trendy Seminole Heights area of Tampa, this was one of the first places to offer the large selection of craft beers in this area. They have live music as well, their schedule of events is located on their website. They have a small parking lot behind their location but also across the street you can park in their larger grass lot. Definitely recommend checking out The Independent!"
